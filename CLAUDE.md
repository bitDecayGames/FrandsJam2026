# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FrandsJam is a HaxeFlixel game built with Haxe, OpenFL/Lime, and FMOD audio. It uses LDTK for level design, integrates with Newgrounds for medals/leaderboards, and reports analytics via Bitlytics/InfluxDB.

## Important Restrictions

- **NEVER attempt to read from or browse the logged-in user's home/user directory.** Do not default to looking in `~/`, `$HOME`, `C:\Users\<username>\`, or any user profile path. Only work within the project directory and paths explicitly provided.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
./bin/init_deps.sh          # Install dependencies from haxelib.deps
lime build html5             # Production build
lime build html5 -debug      # Debug build
lime build hl -debug         # HashLink debug build (preferred for local testing)
./bin/format.sh              # Format Haxe code
./bin/export_ase.sh          # Export Aseprite files to atlases
./bin/generate_events.sh     # Regenerate Event.hx from types.json
./bin/setup_hooks.sh         # Install git hooks
```

**Never run `haxelib set flixel` as part of build commands.** The user manages their flixel version manually.

**Do not run `./bin/run_debug.sh`** — it starts a long-running HTTP server. The user will run this themselves. Use `lime build hl -debug` to compile only.

`./bin/run_llm_debug.sh` builds with the LLM debug bridge and serves on port 8080. Use this to test the game via Playwright. See [LLM Debug Bridge docs](docs/llm-debug-bridge.md) for the full `window.__debug` API.

## Architecture

### Game States (source/states/)
FlxTransitionableState subclasses form the game flow: SplashScreenState → MainMenuState → PlayState → VictoryState/FailState. CreditsState and AchievementsState are accessible from menus.

### Event System (source/events/)
Publish-subscribe bus for game events. Events are **code-generated** from `assets/data/events/types.json` into `source/events/gen/Event.hx`. Use `EventBus.fire()` to emit and `EventBus.subscribe()` to listen. MetricReducer auto-tracks COUNT/MIN/MAX/SUM metrics. EventDerivers transform events into derived events.

### Level System (source/levels/ldtk/)
Levels defined in `assets/world.ldtk` using LDTK editor. Level.hx loads levels and extracts spawn points, terrain, camera zones, and transitions. LdtkTilemap handles rendering.

### Input (source/input/)
SimpleController provides unified keyboard/gamepad/touch input via a Button enum (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, B, START, SELECT). InputCalculator derives cardinal directions.

### Achievements (source/achievements/)
Achievements registered in `Achievements.initAchievements()` with event-based conditions. Persisted via Storage.hx and synced to Newgrounds medals.

### Audio (FMOD)
FmodConstants.hx is auto-generated from the FMOD Studio project in `fmod/`. Use `FmodManager.PlaySong()` / `PlaySoundOneShot()` / `StopSong()`. Constants are in FmodSongs and FmodSFX.

### Player (source/entities/Player.hx)
Player extends FlxSprite (48x48 graphic, 16x16 hitbox). Takes an `FlxState` reference in its constructor so it can add/remove its own child sprites (reticle, power bar, cast bobber) from the scene. Movement speed is 100px/s (150 in hot mode). Uses `InputCalculator.getInputCardinal()` for input and tracks `lastInputDir` for facing direction. Has a `frozen` flag that suppresses movement during cast charging, catch animation, and retrieve (unfreezes only when the bobber is destroyed after reaching the player). Supports multiple skins (Q/E to cycle). Skin loading parses Aseprite JSON atlas (`loadSkin()`) and auto-detects one-shot animations by prefix (`cast_`, `throw_`, `catch_`).

### Fishing Cast System (source/entities/Player.hx)
Cast mechanic uses a `CastState` enum (IDLE → CHARGING → CAST_ANIM → CASTING → LANDED → CATCH_ANIM → RETURNING). Press A (Z key) to start charging — a power bar pulses below the player. Press A again to launch a bobber toward the reticle at a distance proportional to power (max 96px / 6 tiles). Press A or move to retract the bobber at any point (mid-flight, landed). The `CastState` enum is defined at module level in Player.hx.

The bobber launches on frame 3 of the 5-frame cast animation (CAST_LAUNCH_FRAME) using a parabolic arc at 150px/s. The arc uses `updateCastArc()` with formula `arcHeight * 4 * t * (1-t)`. CAST_ANIM clamps the bobber at the target if it arrives during the animation. The same check in CASTING transitions to LANDED.

**Retrieve:** `Player.catchFish(hasFish)` transitions to CATCH_ANIM. The `retractHasFish` flag controls retrieve style: with a fish, the bobber/fish arcs back via `updateCastArc()` at 188px/s; without a fish, straight-line velocity at 188px/s. On catch, the bobber sprite swaps to `fish.png` showing the caught fish frame (`caughtFishSpriteIndex`). CATCH_ANIM → RETURNING keeps `frozen = true`; player unfreezes only when the bobber is destroyed after reaching them. Movement animation is suppressed during CAST_ANIM, CATCH_ANIM, and RETURNING to prevent moonwalking.

**Fish delivery callback:** `onFishDelivered` fires when the bobber/fish reaches the player. PlayState wires this to add the fish to inventory (or spawn a GroundFish if inventory is full). The callback is set before `catchFish()` and nulled after firing.

**Fishing line:** Drawn pixel-by-pixel each frame from rod tip to bobber center. Rod tip positions (`getRodTipPos()`) vary per cast direction and per animation frame. Left/right casts use cubic Bezier curves with downward sag; up/down use Bresenham line drawing.

**Rod tip positions:** Manually calibrated per direction per frame. The CATCH_ANIM/RETURNING branch has 3 frames per direction (frame 0 = cast position, frame 1 = mid-retract, frame 2 = final resting position).

### Fish System (source/entities/)
**FishSpawner** (`FishSpawner.hx`) is a `FlxTypedGroup<WaterFish>` that flood-fills the FishSpawner IntGrid layer to find water bodies, then spawns `WaterFish` into each body. Each FishSpawner LDTK entity has a `numFish` field controlling how many fish spawn in that body. FishSpawner handles separation — when two fish are closer than `SEPARATION_DIST` (20px), **both** flee from each other (not just one). Passes bobber references through to fish via `setBobber()`. Takes an `onCatch` callback in its constructor, wired to each fish at spawn time.

**WaterFish** (`WaterFish.hx`) owns its own bobber-awareness logic using center-to-center distance (`x + width/2, y + height/2`). Each fish has a nullable `bobber` reference and an `onCatch` callback. `checkBobber()` is called when `bobber != null || attracted` — this handles the case where the bobber is retracted while a fish is swimming toward it. Distance thresholds: attract within 32px, catch within 4px. When a fish is attracted and the bobber becomes null (retracted), the fish flees in the opposite direction via `fleeFrom()` then resumes normal wandering. `fleeFrom()` returns immediately if the fish is attracted to a bobber (attraction overrides separation). Flee picks the farthest water tile in the away direction and immediately sets velocity (no pause). Fish fade in over 1 second when spawning/respawning. After being caught, fish respawn at a random water tile after 3 seconds. Fish use `fishShadow.png` sprite with `centerOffsets()` for proper hitbox alignment.

**GroundFish** (`GroundFish.hx`) — fish that land on the ground when the player's inventory is full. Arcs from the player's head position to a random non-water landing spot. Uses `fish.png` spritesheet (32x32 frames, 5 fish types). Has a `FISH_SIZES` lookup table with actual pixel dimensions per frame: `[8,8], [9,9], [12,12], [13,14], [15,16]` (top-left aligned within the 32x32 cell). Origin is set to the center of the actual fish content for proper rotation. While landing (`landing = true`), the fish arcs through the air and can't be picked up. After landing, it flops (sine-wave rotation) and can be picked up by walking over it.

**GroundFishGroup** (`GroundFishGroup.hx`) manages ground fish spawning and pickup. `addFish()` picks a random landing spot 16-32px away, trying up to 20 times to avoid water tiles (checked via the LDTK FishSpawner IntGrid layer). Prevents pickup during landing arc.

**PlayState wiring:** PlayState creates the spawner with an `onFishCaught` callback that sets `player.onFishDelivered` before calling `player.catchFish(true)`. The delivery callback adds fish to inventory; if full, spawns a GroundFish at the player's head (x+8, y-2) using the caught fish's sprite frame (`player.caughtFishSpriteIndex`). Each frame calls `fishSpawner.setBobber(player.isBobberLanded() ? player.castBobber : null)`, `rockGroup.checkPickup(player)`, and `groundFishGroup.checkPickup(player)`.

### Rock Throwing (source/entities/Player.hx, source/entities/Rock.hx)
Press B to throw a rock from inventory toward the reticle (max 96px). The rock arcs via parabolic flight (`arcHeight * 4 * t * (1-t)`, max height = min(dist*0.5, 64)) at 200px/s. Player is frozen during the throw animation. The rock launches on frame 6 of the throw animation. `makeRock` factory is set by PlayState to create rocks that know about the spawner layer. After landing, `resolveThrow()` is called on the rock.

### Inventory (source/entities/Inventory.hx)
Simple array-based inventory with `MAX_SLOTS = 4`. Supports `add()`, `remove()`, `has()`, `isFull()`, `count()`. Items are the `InventoryItem` enum: `Rock`, `Fish`. Fires `onChange` signal on add/remove. InventoryHUD displays current inventory state.

### Networking (source/net/NetworkManager.hx)
Colyseus-based multiplayer. `NetworkManager` manages client connection, room joining, and message passing. Signals: `onJoined`, `onPlayerAdded`, `onPlayerChanged`, `onPlayerRemoved`, `onFishAdded`, `onFishMove`. `IS_HOST` determines whether this client spawns fish/rocks. The `sendMessage()` method has an optional `mute` parameter to suppress per-frame logging (used by `sendMove()`). In `-Dlocal` mode, all methods early-return as no-ops and `IS_HOST` defaults to `true`.

**HARD RULE: never modify the Colyseus library.** The vendored Colyseus SDK under `.haxelib/colyseus/` (and the global haxelib copy) must remain byte-identical to official upstream (`github.com/colyseus/colyseus-haxe`) — no patches, no local hacks, not even "small" ones. `Callbacks.enableMainLoopProcessing()` is genuine upstream code, not a custom addition. Any thread-safety, marshaling, or behavior fix belongs in **our** code (`NetworkManager.hx`), never inside the SDK. If a fix seems to require editing Colyseus, find another way.

**Thread marshaling:** On HashLink (`sys`), Colyseus runs its websocket on a background thread (`Connection.hx` spawns it), so every callback — `joinOrCreate`, `room.onMessage`, and schema listeners — fires off the main thread. Touching HaxeFlixel/render state from that thread crashes HL (`longjmp causes uninitialized stack frame`, then a segfault). NetworkManager hops every callback back to the main thread: schema changes via upstream `enableMainLoopProcessing()` (queues + `haxe.MainLoop.add`), and our own callbacks via `runOnMain()` (wraps `haxe.MainLoop.runInMainThread` on sys, runs inline on html5). All `room.onMessage` registrations go through the `onMsg()` wrapper, never `room.onMessage` directly. Lime pumps the main thread's event loop each frame (`NativeApplication.updateTimer` → `Thread.current().events.progress()`), which is what drains these. The `bin/watch_net.sh` workflow also renames `ssl.hdll` → `ssl.hdll.bak` to dodge a separate SSL-related longjmp on `ws://` connections.

PlayState manages remote players (`remotePlayers` map) and remote fish (`remoteFish` map). Remote players are `Player` instances with `isRemote = true` that skip input processing and are driven by network events.

### Round/Game Management (source/managers/)
**GameManager** (`GameManager.hx`) — singleton (`ME`) that holds the `NetworkManager`, `FishManager`, and orchestrates rounds. Constructed with an array of `Round` definitions. Calls `net.sendMessage("round_update", ...)` at round transitions (lobby, pre-round, post-round, end-game).

**RoundManager** (`RoundManager.hx`) — manages a single round's goals. Signals completion when all goals (or any goal, depending on `allGoalsRequired`) are met. `initialize(state)` is called after PlayState creates to set up round-specific behavior.

**Round status sync (read before touching round/lobby transitions).** The authoritative round status lives in the server's `RoundState` schema (`lobby` → `active` → `post_round` → … → `end_game`). Flow: only the **host** drives transitions; `GameManager.setStatus()` sets local `roundStatus` and (if host) sends a `round_update` message; the server applies it and broadcasts the schema; **every** client's `round` schema listener calls `GameManager.sync()` which sets local `roundStatus` and calls `switchStateBasedOnStatus()` (which `FlxG.switchState`s to LobbyState/PlayState/etc).

Server-side `round_update` semantics (`server/hxsrc/GameRoom.hx`) — critical and non-obvious:
- The server builds a **brand-new `RoundState` object for every `round_update`** (so the schema `round` ref changes and the client `round` listener fires every time), copying current values then overriding only the fields present in the message.
- It only changes `status` **and resets every player's `ready` flag to false** when the message includes a non-null `status`.
- `totalRounds` and `currentRound` are **sticky** server-side — once set they persist across messages that omit them.

**Round summary screen** (`source/states/RoundSummaryState.hx`): on every ACTIVE→POST_ROUND transition the server sells each player's unsold fish (`GameLogic.broadcastRoundSummary()` — prices via `shared/FishValue.hx`, payout applied to `PlayerState.score`, fish removed from inventories) and broadcasts a `round_summary` payload ({sessionId, name, skinIndex, score (pre-sale), fish[{fishType, lengthCm, value}]}). `GameManager.lastRoundSummary` caches it; `RoundSummaryState` (which replaced `PostRoundState` in the flow) polls for it, lines players up by fish value (best on top), and curves each player's fish one by one into a black "shop" box at the bottom center, from last place to first — green money labels pop and running totals tick up. 5s after the last sale every client auto-sends `player_ready`, so the normal all-ready flow starts the next round (or END_GAME after the final round). The summary is animated identically on all clients from the same payload — no extra sync.

Consequences that bit us (don't regress these):
- **Send exactly ONE `round_update` per transition.** Two messages = two schema mutations; if the first is tagged with the old status (e.g. `lobby`) while the host has already advanced itself to `active` locally, `sync()` drags the host backward → infinite `lobby ⇄ active` oscillation that kicks players back to character select.
- `GameManager.init()` (only ever called from `playersReady()`, host + lobby) sets up round data **locally and must NOT broadcast** — `setStatus()` carries `totalRounds` so the single status-transition message propagates metadata. (Earlier bug: `init()` broadcast `status:lobby`/metadata, producing the duplicate mutation above.)
- Known remaining smell (not yet hit since the double-send was removed): `LobbyState.create()` schedules `FlxTimer.wait(2, () -> setStatus(LOBBY))`; that timer is global and can fire after you've left the lobby. If oscillation ever reappears, guard this so it only broadcasts while actually in the lobby.

### Analytics & Storage (source/helpers/)
Analytics.hx reports events to Bitlytics. Storage.hx handles local persistence for achievements and metrics.

## Local Multiplayer Testing

**Server** (Node.js Colyseus, `server/`): build with `cd server && haxe server.hxml`, run with `node dist/server.js` (listens on `ws://localhost:2567`). It's a long-running process — start it once in the background; do not block on it.

**Client builds** connect to that server with `play` + `forcelocal`:
- `lime build hl -Dplay -Dforcelocal` — a player you control.
- add `-Dbot` for the auto-walking second window, `-Ddb` for in-game debug buttons.

**`bin/watch_net.sh`** is the all-in-one harness: starts the server, builds a player window + a bot window, and rebuilds/relaunches on the `.rebuild` signal file. To pick up source changes you must trigger a rebuild (e.g. `touch .rebuild`) — it watches `.rebuild`, not the source tree.

Two HashLink gotchas this harness handles (and why):
- **`ssl.hdll` longjmp:** the script renames `export/hl/bin/ssl.hdll` → `ssl.hdll.bak` before launching. Merely *loading* `ssl.hdll` causes a `longjmp causes uninitialized stack frame` crash on `ws://` (non-TLS) connections. Local builds don't need SSL, so removing the lib avoids it. A fresh `lime build` regenerates `ssl.hdll`, so re-rename after rebuilding if you launch the binary manually.
- **Stale-binary copy bug (fixed):** the script copies the build into `export/hl/bin_player` / `bin_bot` and launches from there. `cp -r src dest` *nests* into `dest/` when `dest` already exists, so it used to launch a stale top-level binary forever (symptom: your fix "doesn't take" and the crash/behavior is identical every run — check the trace **line numbers** against your working tree to detect this). The script now `rm -rf`s the dest first and checks `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (not `$?`, which was reading `tail`'s exit) so failed builds abort instead of relaunching stale binaries.

**Running a client by hand** (what the harness does): `cd export/hl/bin && rm -f ssl.hdll && LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" DISPLAY=:0 ./MyApplication`. There is a real X display (`:0`) on the dev machine, so windowed HL builds run directly.

**Testing etiquette:** the bot window should ONLY walk left/right — do **not** inject input (xdotool, etc.) to puppeteer the ready/round flow. Gameplay-flow changes (round transitions, ready) can be compile-verified and traced against logs, but runtime-verifying them requires the human to drive two windows; ask them to test rather than automating input.

**Agent testing workflow:** See [docs/dev-loop.md](docs/dev-loop.md) for the full development iteration loop. Summary: edit code → `touch .rebuild` → wait ~15s → `tail` log files (`colyseus.log`, `game_player.log`, `game_bot.log`, `build.log`) → `touch .screenshot` for visual checks → iterate. Do NOT run headless HL instances.

**Build verification — MANDATORY after every `.rebuild`:**
After triggering a rebuild, you MUST check for compilation errors BEFORE doing anything else. The verification steps are:
1. `tail -6 build.log` — check the last 6 lines for compile errors. This is the FIRST thing to check.
2. Check BUILD timestamp in game logs to confirm the binary is fresh.
3. Only THEN proceed to check game behavior via logs/screenshots.

Server build output is tee'd to `build.log` with `[server-build]` prefix (haxe produces no stdout on success, only on error). Macros: `Macros.getBuildTimestamp()` in client (`source/misc/Macros.hx`), `BuildInfo.timestamp()` in server (`server/hxsrc/Main.hx`).

**IMPORTANT: There is NO Docker file sync issue.** If the build timestamp hasn't changed, the cause is ALWAYS a compilation error — check `build.log` for errors. Do NOT blame Docker file sync, do NOT use `cp/mv` workarounds. The files are always in sync. If the binary didn't update, the build failed.

## Code Generation Pipelines

**Events:** Edit `assets/data/events/types.json` → run `./bin/generate_events.sh` → generates `source/events/gen/Event.hx`

**Aseprite sprites:** Place `.ase`/`.aseprite` in `art/` → pre-commit hook auto-exports to `assets/aseprite/` as JSON atlases

**FMOD:** Edit FMOD project in `fmod/` → export generates `FmodConstants.hx`

## Global Imports

`source/import.hx` provides project-wide imports: FMOD manager/constants, QuickLog (QLog), DebugSuite (DS), and bitdecay flixel extensions.

## Compile Flags

- `#if debug` / `#if FLX_DEBUG` — debug-only code
- `SKIP_SPLASH` — skip splash screen, go to main menu
- `maingame` — skip all menus, go straight to PlayState (e.g. `lime build hl -debug -Dmaingame`)
- `API_KEY` — analytics token for production
- `dev_analytics` — dev mode analytics
- `llm_bridge` — enable LLM debug bridge (`window.__debug` API for Playwright introspection)
- `local` — legacy offline mode flag. Routes `Configure.getServerURL()` to `"local"` which creates an in-process `LocalRoom` instead of connecting to Colyseus. No `#if local` guards in game code — the `LocalRoom`/`GameLogic` embedded server handles everything through the same code path as multiplayer.
- `play` — start directly in `LobbyState` (real networked multiplayer: connect → character select → ready → round). This is the flag for testing multiplayer. Without it the game boots to `SplashScreenState`.
- `play_solo` — start in `LobbyState` with the in-process `LocalRoom` (single-player: no Colyseus server needed). Lobby shows "Single Player" title, auto-picks skin and readies immediately. Used by `watch_solo.sh`.
- `forcelocal` — point the networked client at the **local** Colyseus dev server: `Configure` hardcodes `ws://localhost:2567`, overriding `config.json` and the `SERVER_URL`/`SERVER_PORT`/`SERVER_PROTOCOL` env/defines. NOT the same as `local` (which removes networking entirely). `forcelocal` is still a real client — use it with `play` to test against a local server. The `#if forcelocal` branches in `Configure.hx` come *before* `#elseif sys`, so they correctly win on native builds.
- `db` — enables in-game debug buttons/tools in `PlayState` (Rock, Big Rock, Pepper, Waders, End Round, Dog, Rocket, Potion, Fish, Bait, Gravity). Items not consumed on use. Fish state labels + scare radius circles shown. Also enables lobby auto-ready when another player joins. Used by `watch_net.sh`.
- `bot` — makes the local `Player` ignore input and just walk left/right on a timer (`Player.hx`, `#if bot`). Used for the second window in `watch_net.sh`. The bot does NOT auto-play (no casting/throwing/readying) — when testing, the bot window should ONLY walk left/right.
- `rocks` — debug flag: fills player inventory with `MAX_SLOTS` rocks at construction time

## Conventions

- Format with `./bin/format.sh` (haxe-formatter)
- Logging: `QLog.notice()`, `QLog.warning()`, `QLog.error()`
- Reference assets via the `AssetPaths` auto-generated class
- Game window: 640x480, 60 FPS
- Tile size: 16x16 pixels
- Entity-specific logic (sprites, state machines, input) belongs in the entity class, not PlayState or group managers. Entities receive an `FlxState` reference to manage their own child sprites. Group classes (spawners, etc.) should only handle spawning, iteration, and data pass-through — behavioral decisions belong in the entity. Use callbacks or events to notify other systems (e.g., fish catch → player state change).
- When positioning sprites, always position by center point using `offset` (i.e. `offset.set(-width/2, -height/2)` or `centerOffsets()`), not by top-left corner origin. The x/y passed in should represent the sprite's center.
- When making sprites visible, set their position before setting `visible = true` to avoid a one-frame flash at the previous location
- Use `FlxPoint.get()`/`.put()` for pooled points; call `.put()` when done to return to pool
- Always use curly braces `{}` around single-line `if`/`else`/`for`/`while` bodies, even when not required by the language
- Use casual language in code comments — say "butt" not "backside", keep it fun
- **Client-server interaction tiers** (see `docs/client-server.md` for full details):
  - **Tier 1 (cosmetic)**: Client-only, no network message. Bush rustle, particles, footsteps. Each client detects overlap locally — including for remote players' interpolated positions.
  - **Tier 2 (stateful)**: Client predicts cosmetics immediately, server validates and broadcasts state change. Bush ignite, weed burst (score), item pickup, fish catch. Score/inventory changes only on server confirmation.
  - SFX always plays immediately on the client that caused the interaction. Never wait for server.

## Inventory Items (source/entities/Inventory.hx)
`InventoryItem` enum: `Rock`, `BigRock`, `Fish(fishSpriteIndex, lengthCm)`, `Waders`, `Rocket`, `HungerPotion`, `FishBait`, `GravityBomb`, `NightVision`. Max 4 slots. `NightVision` is passive while held — doubles the night candle radius and adds a grainy green overlay (see [docs/time-of-day.md](docs/time-of-day.md)). Items granted via the `debug_inventory` message are tagged `debug: true` server-side and are NEVER consumed on use — `GameLogic.serverRemoveItem()` pretends success (so the action still fires) but keeps the item. Only the debug button's remove (`serverRemoveItem(..., force=true)`) deletes them. Dog bite/rocket stun (`serverClearInventory`) still clears everything, debug or not. Debug buttons toggle add/remove.

### Rock Throw (Two-Phase Aiming)
Press B to enter aiming mode — player freezes, reticle turns red and scales 3x, blast radius circle appears. Directional input moves reticle freely (200px/s, any distance). Press B again to throw. Press A to cancel. Server validates and broadcasts `throw_rock`.

### Rocket
Press C to fire in facing direction. Server creates projectile (40→350 px/s acceleration). Smoke trail (500 particles, backward cone). On hit: same stun as dog (3s freeze + flicker + inventory explode). Server applies decelerating knockback slide (0.3s) + broadcasts `player_knockback` to suppress movement animation. Camera shake on fire (client-only). Fish near rocket path flee perpendicular at 2x speed (FEARED state, 1s duration + 1s pause).

### Hunger Potion
Thrown like rock (B button, same arc). Lands in water → server activates hunger in that water body for 10s. All fish in that body chase bobbers from any distance. Client shows green tint overlay on affected water tiles (flood-filled from landing point).

### Fish Bait
Thrown like rock (B button). Lands in water → server activates 15s bait zone (64x44px oval). Fish in same body pick roam targets within oval (including shallow water). No separation enforcement during BAIT_ROAMING state. Client shows golden oval overlay.

### Gravity Bomb
Press V to drop at the player's feet (server validates via `use_gravity_bomb`). For 8s, all players within 112px (lake-sized area — full strength inside, zero outside) get an additive 40px/s pull toward the bomb — applied inside `Simulation.tickPlayer` (via `simulation.gravityWell`) so server, client prediction, and reconciliation replay all match, and normal collision (water, bushes, world) still applies. Remote player interpolation passes `applyWellForces=false` since server positions already include the pull. Players inside the radius get their cast auto-reeled and can't start a new cast (`Player.isGravityAffected()`); outside the radius fishing is unaffected. Visual is `entities/GravityBomb.hx` — pulsing core + swirl particles spiraling inward. One bomb active at a time; cleared on round reset.

### Time of Day & Night Lighting (shared/GameLogic.hx, source/shaders/TimeOfDayShader.hx, source/ui/TimeOfDayHUD.hx)
See [docs/time-of-day.md](docs/time-of-day.md) for the full system. Summary: server-authoritative clock (0-24h, starts at noon, stands still — `TIME_NORMAL_RATE = 0`, only `set_time` moves it); `set_time` fast-forwards at 6 game-hours/sec (sundial HUD buttons: Morning 7:30, Day 12:00, Evening 19:00, Night 0:00); server broadcasts `time_sync` {hour, rate} every 5s, clients integrate locally. `TimeOfDayShader` (camera filter) grades the environment via keyframes — noon = identity, morning soft yellow (~4000K), afternoon warm, evening orange-red (~2200K), night = **pitch black**. At night the only light is the shader's amber light field: a steady candle around the local player (120px, 240px in hot mode, eased) plus up to 16 guide glows (burning bushes 90px full-strength, remote burning players, faint item/dog markers) collected by `PlayState.collectNightGlows()`. Lights compose via screen blend (never `max()` — gradient ridge). OpenFL can't parse array uniforms, hence unrolled `uGlow0..uGlow15`. All screen-space HUD lives on a separate transparent `uiCamera` (created before `loadLevel()`) so the filter never dims it — new HUD elements need `cameras = [uiCamera]`. Night (`GameLogic.isNight()`, 21:00-6:00): seagulls stop spawning (existing ones fly off naturally) and cloud shadows fade via `CloudShadow.visibilityFactor`.

### Power-Up Item Box
Server spawns at random walkable tile. Respawns 5s after pickup. Walking within 14px picks up → adds Rocket to inventory.

## Dog System (source/entities/Dog.hx, shared/GameLogic.hx)
12x12 brown placeholder with `offset.set(6, 6)` for centered rendering. A* pathfinding with line-of-sight smoothing (avoids water, bushes, shallow tiles). States: chasing→waiting→seeking→fleeing. Speed: 100/80/160 px/s. Catches at player visual center. Items drop to walkable tiles only, arc from player, land after 0.5s delay before dog seeks. Auto-spawn disabled (debug button only). Cleared between rounds.

## Fish AI (schema/FishState.hx, shared/GameLogic.hx)
Synced `aiState` field: ROAMING, ATTRACTED, SCARED, FEARED, SPAWNING, DEAD, BAIT_ROAMING. Fish spawn with immediate `pickFishTarget` (no initial pause). Bobber check runs BEFORE pause timer (no delayed attraction). Scared fish fade over 0.5s (client visual). Feared fish stop at shore, allowed into shallow water. Separation skipped for BAIT_ROAMING and FEARED states. Debug state labels under fish silhouettes (`#if db`).

## Entity Architecture Rules
- ONE sprite group per entity type — no duplicate local + server representations
- Bush lookup via `bushByRectIndex: Map<Int, Bush>` — never use FlxGroup array index
- Fish in single `fishSpawner` group — no serverFishGroup, no remoteFish map
- `serverFishState` set for ALL clients (not just local mode)
- All entity state changes must set synced schema fields (e.g., `aiState`)
- `FishSpawner` is a pure container — no AI, no scareFish, no setBobbers
- RockGroup, SeagullPoop, Seagull have no fishSpawner dependency

## Key Sprite Assets
- `assets/aseprite/characters/playerA.json` (and playerB-H) — player skins, 48x48 frames, Aseprite JSON atlas with frame tags for animations
- `assets/aseprite/characters/fishShadow.png` — water fish silhouette sprite
- `assets/aseprite/fish.png` — caught/ground fish spritesheet, 32x32 frames (3 columns x 2 rows), 5 fish types of varying sizes within the cells
- `assets/aseprite/bobber.png` — fishing bobber sprite
- `assets/aseprite/aimingTarget.png` — reticle/aiming target, 8x8 frames, 4-frame animation

## Behavior Tree (BitdecayBTree)

Library: `bitdecaybtree` (installed via `haxelib.deps` from `https://github.com/bitDecayGames/BehaviorTree.git`). Already in `Project.xml`. Debug inspector (`BTreeInspector`) is registered in `Main.hx` via DebugSuite. Enable `-D btree` compile flag for extra logging.

### Core Architecture
- **`BTExecutor`** — drives a tree. Construct with a root `Node`, call `executor.init(ctx)` then `executor.process(delta)` each frame. Has a public `ctx:BTContext` and `status:NodeStatus`.
- **`BTContext`** — shared key-value blackboard (`Map<String, Dynamic>`). Methods: `get(key)`, `set(key, value)`, `has(key)`, `remove(key)`, `getBool(key)`, `getFloat(key)`, `dump()`. All nodes in a tree share one context.
- **`Node`** interface — `init(ctx)`, `process(delta):NodeStatus`, `cancel()`, `clone()`, `getName()`.
- **`NodeStatus`** enum — `UNKNOWN`, `SUCCESS`, `FAIL`, `RUNNING`.

### Node Types

**Composites** (multiple children, `ChildOrder` = `IN_ORDER` or `RANDOM(weights)`):
- `Sequence(order, children)` — runs children in order; returns SUCCESS if ALL succeed, FAIL on first failure (logical AND). Re-inits children that were UNKNOWN before processing.
- `Fallback(order, children)` — runs children in order; returns SUCCESS on first success, FAIL if all fail (logical OR).
- `Parallel(condition, children)` — runs ALL children every tick. `EndCondition`: `FAIL_ON_FIRST_FAIL`, `SUCCEED_ON_FIRST_SUCCESS`, `UNTIL_N_COMPLETE(n)`, `UNTIL_ALL_COMPLETE`.

**Decorators** (single child, wrap behavior):
- `Inverter(child)` — flips SUCCESS↔FAIL, passes RUNNING through.
- `Succeeder(child)` — always returns SUCCESS when child completes (regardless of child status).
- `Failer(child)` — always returns FAIL when child completes.
- `Repeater(type, child)` — `RepeatType`: `FOREVER`, `COUNT(n)`, `UNTIL_FAIL(max)`, `UNTIL_SUCCESS(max)`. Max of 0 = no limit.
- `TimeLimit(time, child)` — returns FAIL if child doesn't finish within time limit. Cancels child on timeout.
- `HierarchicalContext(child)` — creates a scoped sub-context. Child writes are local; reads fall back to parent context.
- `Subtree(name)` — looks up a named tree from `Registry` and clones it as the child.

**Leaf Nodes** (terminal, business logic):
- `Action(name, wrappedFunc)` — runs callback `(ctx) -> Void`, always returns SUCCESS. Use for fire-and-forget side effects.
- `StatusAction(name, wrappedProcessFunc, ?onCancel)` — runs callback `(ctx, delta) -> NodeStatus`, returns whatever the callback returns. The main way to write custom behavior that can return RUNNING. Optional `onCancel` callback `(ctx) -> Void`.
- `Condition(name, type)` — returns SUCCESS or FAIL. `ConditionType`: `VAR_SET(varName)` (checks context key exists), `VAR_CMP(varName, comparison)` (LT/LTE/GT/GTE/EQ/NEQ against a value), `FUNC(wrappedConditionFunc)` (custom `(ctx) -> Bool`).
- `Wait(min, ?max)` — returns RUNNING until time elapses, then SUCCESS. Random duration between min and max. `Time` enum: `CONST(seconds)` or `VAR(contextKey, fallbackSeconds)`.
- `SetVariable(name, valueType)` — sets a context variable. `ValueType`: `CONST(val)`, `FROM_CTX(key)`, `TIMESTAMP(offsetSeconds)`.
- `RemoveVariable(name)` — removes a context variable, always SUCCESS.
- `IsVarNull(name)` — SUCCESS if var is unset/null, FAIL if set.
- `Success` / `Fail` — always return their respective status.

### Wrapped Functions (BT.wrapFn macro)
All Action/StatusAction/Condition callbacks must be wrapped with `BT.wrapFn()` for debug tooling:
```haxe
new Action("do thing", BT.wrapFn(myFunction));
new StatusAction("move to target", BT.wrapFn(moveToTarget));
new Condition("has fish?", FUNC(BT.wrapFn(checkHasFish)));
```
`BT.wrapFn()` is a macro that captures the function name, file, and line number for the inspector.

### Registry (Subtrees)
`Registry.register(name, tree)` saves a tree blueprint. `new Subtree(name)` clones and injects it. Useful for reusable behavior patterns.

### Shorthand Helpers
`Shorthand.interrupter(condition, child)` — creates a Sequence that inverts the condition check (aborts child while condition is true).

### Usage Pattern
```haxe
import bitdecay.behavior.tree.*;
import bitdecay.behavior.tree.composite.*;
import bitdecay.behavior.tree.decorator.*;
import bitdecay.behavior.tree.leaf.*;
import bitdecay.behavior.tree.context.BTContext;

// Build tree
var tree = new Fallback(IN_ORDER, [
    new Sequence(IN_ORDER, [
        new Condition("water nearby?", FUNC(BT.wrapFn(isWaterNearby))),
        new StatusAction("walk to water", BT.wrapFn(walkToWater)),
        new StatusAction("cast line", BT.wrapFn(castLine)),
        new Wait(CONST(2.0), CONST(5.0)),
        new Action("reel in", BT.wrapFn(reelIn))
    ]),
    new Sequence(IN_ORDER, [
        new Wait(CONST(0.5), CONST(1.5)),
        new Action("wander", BT.wrapFn(wander))
    ])
]);

// Create executor and tick each frame
var executor = new BTExecutor(tree);
executor.init(new BTContext());
// In update():
executor.process(elapsed);
```
